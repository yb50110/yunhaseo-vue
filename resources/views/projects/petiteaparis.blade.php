    <p class="body">
        A small, local clothing business of Velp, Netherlands was in need of an illustration that represented her
        clothing and that could be used throughout her store as a decorative element. She targeted women in their
        late 20’s and early 20’s and displayed a sense of elegance and modernism.

    <p class="body">
        Through carefully observing her clothing, and after a few iterations of feedback, this illustration
        was selected as the final piece.

    <p class="body">
        I visited her shop while at the Netherlands and was happy to see the illustration being used within
        her business cards and various goods around her shop.

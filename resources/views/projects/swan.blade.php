    <p class="body">
        The client was creating an app called Swan that is aimed at finding a housekeeper quickly. Although not much
        information was revealed, he did mention that it was like an <i>Uber</i> for housekeeping and wanted the
        color pink to be a prominent color.

    <p class="body">
        Through the tight deadline, there were two feedback moments. I provided the client with sketches and proceeded
        with the one with he felt would best fit his needs. Communication happened very freely and casually
        through online media.
